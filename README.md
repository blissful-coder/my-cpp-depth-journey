# My C++ Depth Journey

This repository documents my journey to re-learn and deepen my expertise in modern C++ for backend and architectural roles, with a focus on high-performance, distributed systems, and AI integration.

## Goals:
- Master modern C++ (C++17/20/23) features and best practices.
- Build high-performance, concurrent, and distributed systems.
- Understand and apply core AI/ML concepts from a backend perspective (model serving, inference optimization).
- Develop strong system design and architectural skills.
- Engage in competitive programming to sharpen DSA.
- Contribute to open-source C++ projects.

## Projects:
- : High-Performance, Concurrent Key-Value Store (In-Memory)
- : Asynchronous HTTP Server with Thread Pool
- : Real-time AI Inference Service with gRPC
- : Microservice Architecture - Smart Notification System

## Learning Resources:
- Books: "Effective Modern C++", "C++ Concurrency in Action", "Designing Data-Intensive Applications".
- Online Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks.
- Documentation: cppreference.com, Boost.Asio, gRPC, TensorFlow C++ API, ONNX Runtime.
- Blogs: isocpp.org, Preshing on Programming, MartinFowler.com, MAANG engineering blogs.

## Current Phase:
Refer to  for daily progress and detailed learning notes.

## Setup:
- Ensure CMake is installed.
- Ensure  has been run for C++ compiler tools.
- (Optional) Use a C++-friendly IDE like VS Code with C/C++ and CMake Tools extensions, or CLion.

Feel free to explore the projects and documentation!
